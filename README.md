## Cybersecurity Talent Gap

The cybersecurity industry continues to face a significant talent gap despite growing demand. According to **Lightcast.io**, the U.S. had over **1.5 million cybersecurity job openings in 2024**, with only about **1.28 million workers available**. This leaves a gap of approximately **225,200 professionals**. The demand for cybersecurity talent spans multiple industries, with mid-level roles (requiring **2-10 years of experience**) facing the highest shortages.

### Talent Gap Calculator

To illustrate this talent gap, a simple web-based calculator was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator allows users to input the total number of cybersecurity job openings and the available workforce, then calculates the talent gap based on these inputs.

#### How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML form includes input fields for users to enter the total number of job openings and the available workforce. A button initiates the calculation.

- **CSS Styling**: Basic CSS styling is applied to center the calculator on the page and provide a clean, user-friendly interface. The button changes color when hovered to enhance interactivity.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: When the button is clicked, a JavaScript function retrieves the input values, calculates the difference (talent gap), and displays the result directly on the page. If the user enters invalid data, an error message appears to guide them.

This tool visually demonstrates the concept of the talent gap and allows users to interact with data to better understand the demand for cybersecurity professionals.
